## Quick Selection Guide

**Choose based on your needs:**

| Your Goal | Start Here |
|-----------|-----------|
| Complete beginner | Agent 1: Fundamentals |
| Want to write functions | Agent 2: Functions & Scope |
| Working with data | Agent 3: Objects & Arrays |
| API/network operations | Agent 4: Asynchronous |
| Building webpages | Agent 5: DOM & Browser APIs |
| Modern syntax | Agent 6: Modern ES6+ |
| Professional projects | Agent 7: Ecosystem |

## Agent Dependencies

The agents are designed to build on each other:

```
1. Fundamentals
    ↓
2. Functions & Scope ←─┐
    ↓                  │
3. Objects & Arrays ──┤
    ↓                  │
4. Asynchronous ───────┤
    ↓                  │
5. DOM & Browser APIs ─┤

6. Modern ES6+ ────────┤
    ↓                  │
7. Ecosystem ──────────┘
```

**Recommended Order:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7

**Can Skip Ahead:** If you have prior knowledge, you can start with later agents

## How to Invoke an Agent

In Claude Code, you can invoke agents directly:

```
As a user, you can ask me to invoke any agent by name:

- "Teach me about JavaScript Fundamentals"
- "I need help with closures" (Functions & Scope Agent)
- "Show me array methods" (Objects & Arrays Agent)
- "Explain async/await" (Asynchronous Agent)
- "How do I select DOM elements?" (DOM & Browser APIs)
- "What are arrow functions?" (Modern ES6+ Agent)
- "How do I set up npm?" (Ecosystem Agent)
```

## Skills Quick Reference

Each agent is backed by a specialized **skill** with practical code examples:

- `fundamentals` - Variables, operators, control flow
- `functions` - Function patterns and scope chains
- `data-structures` - Objects, arrays, inheritance
- `asynchronous` - Promises, async/await, event loop
- `dom-apis` - DOM selection, events, Fetch
- `modern-javascript` - ES6+, classes, modules
- `ecosystem` - npm, tools, testing, frameworks
